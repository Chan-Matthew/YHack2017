# Potato
Enhancing student performance with the added bonus of obtaining rewards

## Inspiration

Lack of motivation to study and lack of free food for not so prosperous students.

## What it does

On potato, our broad rewards program grants you a chance to earn points and credits through doing a variety of options. Completing problem sets that are selected from your very own professor, you can review for your courses and help reinforce concepts learned in class. Each problem set completed will grant you 5 points in the rewards program of your choice and available to redeem.
